# DDOS-Attack-Prevention
The defense mechanism is multi-level and is explained in two phases- the client puzzle phase and cooperating cache servers phase.The proposed scheme caters to the above issues in designing of the DDoS defense schemes. It fights against DDoS attack by mitigating the attack traffic and allowingselective access to the services offered by the server. It is executed in two different phases according to the value allocated to the volume metric variable by the traffic checker module for the incoming packets.For
evaluation of the performance of proposed approach, we did its simulation in network
simulator NS2. It is done to find out the expected performance of the defense scheme under
two conditions. Firstly, when the defense mechanism is in place and secondly, when there
is no defense mechanism.
