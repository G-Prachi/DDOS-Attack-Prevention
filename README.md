# DDOS-Attack-Prevention
The defense mechanism is multi-level and is explained in two phases- the client puzzle phase and cooperating cache servers phase. This defense scheme fights against DDoS attack by mitigating the attack traffic and allowing selective access to the services offered by the server. It is executed in two different phases according to the value allocated to the volume metric variable by the traffic checker module for the incoming packets.For
evaluation of the performance of proposed approach, we did its simulation in network
simulator NS2. It is done to find out the expected performance of the defense scheme under
two conditions. Firstly, when the defense mechanism is in place and secondly, when there
is no defense mechanism.

A prototype of continuous double-auction mechanism using Actor Architecture
(AA) is built and extensive analysis of the double auction mechanism of cache trading is done
with key objectives to provide crucial insights on mitigation of the traffic flood. The design
of the simulation analysis comprises of Bitbrains dataset of 1250 server machines
whose configuration is used for optimal allocation. To select the optimal caches, the
MATLAB R2013a version is used in the laptop of Intel Core i3 processor, RAM 4GB,
operating system-64 bit. The schedule of workflows is preprocessed and is fed to the whale
algorithm and the results are stored in a CSV file which is inputted to the AA using Engine
API. The above is MATLAB implementation in which the opltimal cache
resources are being selected from the Bitbrains dataset using Whale Optimization Algorithm. 

In the simulation a heterogeneous kind of network having of different types of traffic is
considered, and defense is done under three attack load condition of the network traffic.
The proposed scheme is evaluated with different client load values by taking a variable
amount of incoming attack packets to calculate the drop rate of benign and malicious
packets. This simulation is done with two types of packet floods: TCP packet flood and
under UDP packet flood, in both the cases similar performance is observed. In DPM
module simulation, minimum charge policy in kept in policy handler which is then
expanded to round-wise iterations. 

The results illustrate a significant convergence in the detection rate of the optimal
cache servers.The
throughput variation of WOA with simulation time of about 3.6 seconds for 1000 iterations
is also shown which explains that the attack traffic is not
only diverted to the cache servers but the diversion is done in a proportional and balanced
manner.
